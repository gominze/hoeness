# Pure Liquid

Pure Liquid is a collection of Jekyll projects written using *just* Liquid (most of which were allegedly written while under the influence of something).

If you're going to build a **static** website, why even bother using JavaScript when you don't have to? Unless I'm building the whole front-end in JavaScript, I will avoid JavaScript as much as I can.

## Building

This is a standard Jekyll website with no plug-ins, no javascript, and no gems.

1. Clone the website
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/allejo/pure-liquid.allejo.org.git
   ```
1. Download the Jekyll dependencies
   ```
   bundle install
   ```
1. Build or serve the website
   ```
   bundle exec jekyll build
   ```
